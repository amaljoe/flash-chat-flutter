# Flash Chat ⚡️

This is one of the many apps I made while learning flutter and I like this one the most which not only has some real functionality but also has a beautiful UI.

The objective of making this app was to learn how to incorporate Firebase into Flutter apps. I used Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase authentication package to equip this app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods. I also learnt implicit and explicit animations along the journey.


## Some things to note:
- Incorporated Firebase into Flutter app.  
- Used Firebase authentication to register and sign in users.
- Created beautiful animations using the Flutter Hero widget.
- Implemented Custom aniamtions using Flutter's animation controller. 
- Learnt all about mixins and how they differ from superclasses.
- Learnt about Streams and how they work.
- Used ListViews to build scrolling views.
- Learnt how to use Firebase Cloud Firestore to store and retrieve data on the fly.
